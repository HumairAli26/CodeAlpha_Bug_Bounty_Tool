# CodeAlpha_Bug_Bounty_Tool
This Python script is a simple bug bounty scanning tool. It first asks for user permission, then scans given target websites for missing security headers and common sensitive paths like /admin, .env, or robots.txt. It supports multiple targets, runs scans in parallel with error handling, and saves detailed JSON results.
